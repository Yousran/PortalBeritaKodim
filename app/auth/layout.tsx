/**
 * Auth Layout — Server Component Guard
 *
 * Redirects already-authenticated users away from /auth/signin and
 * /auth/signup so they cannot reach the login forms once signed in.
 *
 * Middleware already handles this via the session cookie, but this layout
 * provides a server-side safety net in case the cookie check is bypassed
 * (e.g. a fresh cookie that middleware hasn't seen yet).
